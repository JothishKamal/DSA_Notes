- Collection of data members under one name is structure
-  Data members can be of similar type or non similar type
-  When structures is called in the main( ) program then it will consume space accordingly to the data members types it contains in the memory

**Note:**
Padding of memory is done in structures, i.e, even though char only takes 1 byte it'll allocate 4 bytes because it's easier for the machine to read 4 bytes at a time.

Code:
```cpp
struct Card{
  int face;
  int color;
  int shape;
}

int main(){


}
```
